## Portfolio Strategy & Next Steps

### Portfolio Balance

- **Medium Risk (Gap fillers)**: Games 1, 2, 3 - Data-driven market gaps with clear demand
- **High Risk (Innovation)**: Games 7, 8, 9, 10 - Novel mechanics, niche audiences, first-mover bets

**Investment Tiers**:
- **Small ($50K-200K)**: Games 5, 10 - Solo/small team indie productions
- **Medium ($500K-2M)**: Games 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 - AA indie with focused scope
- **Large ($5M-15M)**: Games 3, 8 - Large-scale requiring significant tech/content investment

**Timeline to Market**:

- **24-30 months**: Games 3, 8 - Complex tech, large content needs

### Recommended Prioritization

**Phase 1 (Validate Market)**:
1. **Game 10 (Immersion)** - Fastest to market, validates demand, builds community
2. **Game 5 (Bunker 7)** - Small budget, proven roguelike market, 6-month dev cycle

**Phase 2 (Fill High-Priority Gaps)**:
3. **Game 2 (Homeland: Duskfall)** - PvE extraction proves Duckov market can scale
4. **Game 1 (Sentinel Protocol)** - Highest priority gap (94/100), tactical shooter void

**Phase 3 (Diversify)**:
5. **Game 4 (Neon Divide)** - F2P competitive for recurring revenue
6. **Game 6 (Last Stand: Homestead)** - Co-op PvE for different audience segment

**Phase 4 (Big Bets)**:
7. **Game 3 (Operation: Sandstorm)** - Large-scale BF alternative if early games succeed
8. **Game 8 (Gridiron: 2087)** - High-risk viral potential if funding secured

**Optional (Niche)**:
- **Game 7 (Chrono Breach)** - Passion project for creative developers
- **Game 9 (Recon: Cold Harbor)** - If asymmetric FPS trend resurges

### Success Metrics by Game

Each concept should track:
- **Development**: On-time, on-budget delivery
- **Launch**: First week sales/downloads vs. target
- **Retention**: D1, D7, D30 player retention rates
