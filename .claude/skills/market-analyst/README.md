# Market Analyst Skill

## Quick Start

This skill analyzes multiple Reddit sentiment reports to identify market trends, gaps, and opportunities.

## What It Does

**Input**: 2+ sentiment analysis reports (from reddit-sentiment-analysis skill)

**Output**: Comprehensive market analysis with:
- ‚úÖ Universal success factors (what always works)
- ‚ùå Universal pain points (what always fails)
- üéØ Market gaps & opportunities (unmet demand)
- üí° Novelty innovations (unique successes to replicate)
- üîÆ Predicted hits (likely successful products)
- üìä Strategic recommendations (actionable insights)

## Basic Usage

### Analyze Existing Reports

```
"Analyze the gaming sentiment reports in /docs and identify market opportunities"
```

The skill will:
1. Load all `reddit-sentiment-*.md` files from `/docs/`
2. Extract structured data (likes, dislikes, wishes)
3. Find patterns across all products
4. Identify gaps and opportunities
5. Generate comprehensive market analysis report

### With Stream-Chain Pipeline

```
Use stream-chain to:
1. Run reddit sentiment analysis on [5 products]
2. Feed results to market-analyst skill
3. Generate market opportunity report
```

## Output Structure

The skill generates a detailed report including:

### 1. Universal Success Factors
What drives satisfaction across ALL products analyzed:
- Features/aspects present in 50%+ products
- High positive sentiment (85%+)
- Representative quotes and evidence

**Example**:
```
‚úÖ Responsive Controls (5/5 products, 92% positive)
   - Players consistently praise tight, responsive gameplay
   - Critical for player satisfaction
   - Must-have feature for this category
```

### 2. Universal Pain Points
What consistently frustrates users across products:
- Issues appearing in 60%+ products
- High severity ratings
- Root causes and prevention strategies

**Example**:
```
‚ùå Aggressive Monetization (4/5 products, 94% negative, HIGH severity)
   - $70 base price + battle passes + cosmetic MTX
   - Players feel nickel-and-dimed
   - Avoid: Layer multiple monetization systems
```

### 3. Market Gaps (Prioritized)
Unmet demand with opportunity scores:
- Feature gaps (wished for, nobody delivers)
- Segment gaps (underserved audiences)
- Price gaps (wrong pricing tiers)
- Business model gaps (better service models)

**Example**:
```
üéØ 2-3 Year Game Lifecycles - Priority: 92/100
   - Demand: Mentioned in 4/5 products, HIGH urgency
   - Gap: All games have 1-year support cycles
   - Opportunity: Game with committed 3-year roadmap
   - Market size: $500M+ (estimated TAM)
```

### 4. Novelty Successes
Unique innovations that could be replicated:
- What makes them unique
- Why they work
- Transferability to other products
- Replicability assessment

**Example**:
```
üí° Omnimovement System (Call of Duty BO6)
   - Unique: Sprint/slide/dive in any direction
   - Why it works: Increases skill ceiling, feels fluid
   - Transferable: Yes, to any movement-based game
   - Replicability: MEDIUM (requires animation system overhaul)
```

### 5. Predicted Hits
Products/concepts likely to succeed based on data:
- Hit probability score
- Alignment with success factors
- Gap-filling potential
- Risk assessment

**Example**:
```
üîÆ Tactical Extraction Shooter at $25 - Hit Probability: 87%
   ‚úÖ Aligns with success factors: 91/100
   ‚úÖ Avoids pain points: 88/100
   ‚úÖ Fills gaps: 94/100
   ‚úÖ Has novelty: 65/100
   ‚úÖ Price/value: 95/100
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Consistent Category
‚úÖ Analyze products in the same category
‚ùå Don't mix FPS games with puzzle games

### 2. Balanced Sample
‚úÖ Include successful AND struggling products
‚ùå Don't only analyze hits (creates survivorship bias)

### 3. Recent Data
‚úÖ Use sentiment reports from similar time period
‚ùå Don't mix 2023 data with 2025 data

### 4. Sufficient Volume
‚úÖ Minimum 3 products for reliable patterns
‚ùå 2 products = too small for cross-analysis

‚Üí Reports may be outdated (use recent data)

**"Predicted hits seem unrealistic"**
‚Üí Check data quality of input reports
‚Üí Validate assumptions with market research
‚Üí Consider feasibility constraints

**"Recommendations too generic"**
