# Market Analyst Skill

## Purpose

This skill consumes outputs from the **reddit-sentiment-analysis** skill to perform meta-analysis across multiple products/games. It identifies:
- **Common patterns** across successful products (what universally drives satisfaction)
- **Market gaps** where demand exists but supply is lacking
- **Underserved segments** with unmet needs
- **Novelty opportunities** where unique approaches could succeed
- **Predicted hits** based on cross-product sentiment intelligence
- **Strategic recommendations** for product development and positioning

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you have:
- ✅ Multiple sentiment analysis reports (2+ products/games analyzed)
- ✅ Need to identify market opportunities across a product category
- ✅ Want to predict which upcoming products will succeed
- ✅ Looking for gaps in the market based on user sentiment
- ✅ Need strategic recommendations for product development
- ✅ Want to understand what makes products succeed or fail

## Prerequisites

1. **Input Data**: 2+ Reddit sentiment analysis reports in `/docs/`
   - Generated by `reddit-sentiment-analysis` skill
   - Must follow standard format with LIKES/DISLIKES/WISHES sections
   - Recent data (ideally within same time period)

2. **Analysis Scope**: Clear product category (e.g., FPS games, productivity apps, streaming services)

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Normalization

**1. Identify Available Sentiment Reports**
   - Scan `/docs/` for `reddit-sentiment-*.md` files
   - Parse each report to extract structured data
   - Validate format and completeness

**2. Extract Key Data Points**

For each product/game analyzed, extract:

```javascript
{
  product_name: string,
  overall_sentiment: {positive: %, negative: %, neutral: %},
  likes: [
    {aspect: string, mentions: number, sentiment: %, quotes: []}
  ],
  dislikes: [
    {aspect: string, mentions: number, severity: string, quotes: []}
  ],
  wishes: [
    {feature: string, mentions: number, urgency: string, quotes: []}
  ],
  key_insights: [],
  competitor_mentions: {}
}
```

### Phase 2: Cross-Product Pattern Analysis

**3. Identify Universal Success Factors**

Analyze LIKES across all products to find patterns:

**Pattern Detection Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Group similar aspects across products
const commonLikes = groupSimilarAspects(allProducts.likes);

// Calculate frequency and consistency
for (aspect in commonLikes) {
  const frequency = countProducts(aspect);
  const avgSentiment = calculateAverage(aspect.sentiment);
  const consistency = calculateVariance(aspect.sentiment);

  if (frequency >= 50% && avgSentiment >= 85% && consistency < 15%) {
    markAs("Universal Success Factor");
  }
}
```

**Success Factor Categories:**
- **Gameplay/Functionality**: Core mechanics, features, usability
- **Value Proposition**: Pricing, content volume, value-for-money
- **Polish/Quality**: Performance, visuals, stability, UX
- **Community/Social**: Multiplayer, social features, community engagement
- **Innovation**: Novel mechanics, creative approaches, unique features

**4. Identify Universal Pain Points**

Analyze DISLIKES across all products:

```javascript
// Find recurring complaints
const commonDislikes = groupSimilarIssues(allProducts.dislikes);

// Classify by universality
for (issue in commonDislikes) {
  const frequency = countProducts(issue);
  const avgSeverity = calculateSeverity(issue);

  if (frequency >= 60% && avgSeverity === "HIGH") {
    markAs("Industry-Wide Problem");
  }
}
```

**Pain Point Categories:**
- **Monetization Issues**: Aggressive MTX, pay-to-win, expensive pricing
- **Technical Problems**: Performance, bugs, server issues
- **Design Flaws**: Poor UX, frustrating mechanics, balance issues
- **Content/Feature Gaps**: Missing features, lack of variety
- **Business Model Issues**: Live service problems, abandonment fears

**5. Analyze Wish Patterns**

Examine WISHES to identify unmet demand:

```javascript
// Find common wishes across products
const universalWishes = groupSimilarWishes(allProducts.wishes);

// Calculate demand intensity
for (wish in universalWishes) {
  const demandScore = wish.frequency * wish.avgUrgency * wish.mentions;

  if (demandScore > THRESHOLD) {
    markAs("High-Demand Unmet Need");
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Gap Identification and Market Opportunity Analysis

**6. Identify Market Gaps**

**Gap Detection Framework:**

**Type 1: Feature Gaps** (Widely wished for, nobody delivers)
```
IF: Wish appears in 3+ products
AND: Urgency >= MEDIUM across all
AND: No product currently delivers it
THEN: Feature Gap Opportunity
```

**Type 2: Segment Gaps** (Underserved audience)
```
IF: Common complaint about product not serving a specific need
AND: No product specifically targets that need
THEN: Segment Gap Opportunity
```

**Type 3: Price/Value Gaps** (Wrong pricing tier)
```
IF: Multiple products criticized for pricing
AND: Wishes mention "more affordable option" or "premium option"
AND: No product fills that price point
THEN: Price Gap Opportunity
```

**Type 4: Business Model Gaps** (Better service model needed)
```
IF: Common complaints about monetization/lifecycle
AND: Alternative model wished for across products
THEN: Business Model Gap Opportunity
```

**7. Calculate Gap Priority Score**

```javascript
gapPriorityScore = (
  demandIntensity * 0.35 +        // How many people want it
  competitiveGap * 0.25 +          // How few products offer it
  urgencyLevel * 0.20 +            // How badly it's needed
  marketSize * 0.15 +              // Addressable market size
  feasibility * 0.05               // Technical/business feasibility
) * 100
```

**Priority Tiers:**
- **CRITICAL (90-100)**: Massive demand, no competition, urgent need
- **HIGH (75-89)**: Strong demand, minimal competition, clear need
- **MEDIUM (60-74)**: Moderate demand, some competition, growing need
- **LOW (40-59)**: Niche demand, crowded market, optional feature

### Phase 4: Novelty Detection and Innovation Analysis

**8. Identify Outlier Successes**

Find products/features praised uniquely:

```javascript
// Detect novelty
for (product in allProducts) {
  for (like in product.likes) {
    const uniqueness = calculateUniqueness(like, otherProducts);
    const sentiment = like.sentiment;

    if (uniqueness > 80% && sentiment > 85%) {
      markAs("Novelty Success", {
        feature: like.aspect,
        product: product.name,
        why_unique: analyzeWhy(like),
        replicability: assessReplicability(like)
      });
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty Categories:**
- **Mechanic Innovation**: Unique gameplay/feature never seen before
- **Design Innovation**: Novel UX/UI approach or artistic direction
- **Business Model Innovation**: New monetization or service model
- **Community Innovation**: Unique social/multiplayer approach
- **Accessibility Innovation**: Solving problems in new ways

**9. Assess Novelty Replicability**

For each novelty success:
- **Transferable to other products?** (YES/NO/PARTIAL)
- **Category-specific or universal?** (UNIVERSAL/CATEGORY/PRODUCT)
- **Competitive moat strength?** (WEAK/MEDIUM/STRONG)
- **First-mover advantage duration?** (MONTHS/YEARS/PERMANENT)

### Phase 5: Predictive Analysis and Recommendations

**10. Predict Likely Hits**

**Hit Prediction Algorithm:**

```javascript
function predictHitPotential(productConcept) {
  const score = {
    alignsWithSuccessFactors: 0,    // Does it have universal likes?
    avoidsCommonPitfalls: 0,         // Does it avoid universal dislikes?
    addressesUnmetNeeds: 0,          // Does it fill market gaps?
    hasNoveltyFactor: 0,             // Does it innovate?
    priceValueProposition: 0         // Is pricing right?
  };

  // Score each dimension (0-100)
  score.alignsWithSuccessFactors = checkAlignment(productConcept, universalSuccessFactors);
  score.avoidsCommonPitfalls = checkAvoidance(productConcept, universalPainPoints);
  score.addressesUnmetNeeds = checkGapFilling(productConcept, marketGaps);
  score.hasNoveltyFactor = checkNovelty(productConcept, noveltySuccesses);
  score.priceValueProposition = checkPricing(productConcept, pricingAnalysis);

  const hitProbability = (
    score.alignsWithSuccessFactors * 0.30 +
    score.avoidsCommonPitfalls * 0.25 +
    score.addressesUnmetNeeds * 0.25 +
    score.hasNoveltyFactor * 0.15 +
    score.priceValueProposition * 0.05
  );

  return {
    probability: hitProbability,
    confidence: calculateConfidence(dataQuality, sampleSize),
    breakdown: score,
    recommendations: generateRecommendations(score)
  };
}
```

**11. Generate Strategic Recommendations**

**Product Development Recommendations:**
```markdown
### Must-Have Features (Universal Success Factors)
1. [Feature] - Present in X/Y products with Z% positive sentiment
   - Why it matters: [explanation]
   - How to implement: [guidance]

### Critical Pitfalls to Avoid (Universal Pain Points)
1. [Issue] - Complained about in X/Y products with Z severity
   - Why it fails: [explanation]
   - How to avoid: [guidance]

### Market Gap Opportunities (High Priority)
1. [Gap] - Priority Score: XX/100
   - Demand evidence: [data]
   - Competition: [current state]
   - Recommended approach: [strategy]
```

**12. Create Market Opportunity Matrix**

```
                    HIGH NOVELTY
                         |
    LOW DEMAND    Q2: Risky Innovation    Q1: Blue Ocean    HIGH DEMAND
                         |                       |
                  Q3: Avoid/Niche        Q4: Proven Demand
                         |
                    LOW NOVELTY

Q1 (High Demand + High Novelty): PRIORITY - Innovate in underserved areas
Q2 (Low Demand + High Novelty): RISKY - Innovation without market validation
Q3 (Low Demand + Low Novelty): AVOID - Crowded, low-interest space
Q4 (High Demand + Low Novelty): SAFE - Proven market, execution differentiator
```

**Report Generated By**: Market Analyst Skill v1.0
**Based On**: [X] Reddit Sentiment Analysis Reports
**Data Sources**: Reddit (r/[subreddits])
**Analysis Date**: [Date]
```

## Implementation Protocol

### Step 1: Create Analysis Plan

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  "Identify and load all sentiment analysis reports",
  "Extract structured data from each report",
  "Identify universal success factors across products",
  "Identify universal pain points across products",
  "Analyze wish patterns for unmet demand",
  "Calculate market gap priority scores",
  "Detect novelty successes and assess replicability",
  "Predict likely hits and generate recommendations",
  "Create market opportunity matrix",
  "Generate comprehensive market analysis report"
])
```

### Step 2: Data Loading

**CRITICAL**: Batch all file reads in parallel:

```javascript
[Single Message - Parallel Report Loading]:
  Read("/docs/reddit-sentiment-analysis-game1.md")
  Read("/docs/reddit-sentiment-analysis-game2.md")
  Read("/docs/reddit-sentiment-analysis-game3.md")
  Read("/docs/reddit-sentiment-analysis-game4.md")
  Read("/docs/reddit-sentiment-analysis-game5.md")
```

### Step 3: Cross-Product Analysis

Process all reports simultaneously to identify:
- Common likes (appear in 50%+ of products)
- Common dislikes (appear in 60%+ of products)
- Common wishes (appear in 40%+ of products)
- Unique features (appear in <25% of products but highly praised)

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

For each identified wish pattern:
1. Calculate demand score (frequency × urgency × mentions)
2. Assess competitive landscape (who's trying to fill this?)
3. Estimate market size (based on product reach)
4. Assign priority score

### Step 5: Report Generation

Save comprehensive report to:
`/docs/market-analysis-[category]-[date].md`

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Analyze minimum 3 products for meaningful patterns
✅ Use recent sentiment data (within 3 months)
✅ Consider product category context (FPS games ≠ puzzle games)
✅ Weight by sample size (1000 comments > 50 comments)
✅ Look for sentiment intensity, not just direction
✅ Consider temporal trends (sentiment changing over time)
✅ Cross-reference competitor mentions
✅ Validate gaps with market research

### DON'T:
❌ Mix incompatible product categories (games + productivity apps)
❌ Over-generalize from small sample sizes
❌ Ignore context (niche vs. mainstream products)
❌ Assume correlation = causation
❌ Miss seasonal/event-driven sentiment spikes
❌ Ignore demographic differences in sentiment
❌ Recommend unfeasible solutions
