# FitFinder 🎯

**Accelerate Product/Market Fit with AI Agents and Skills**

FitFinder leverages multi-agent AI systems and specialized skills to help you identify **what to build** and **who to build it for** — the two critical components of achieving product/market fit.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Use AI-powered agents to:
- **Discover market opportunities** through intelligent research and analysis
- **Identify target audiences** with precision segmentation
- **Validate product ideas** before writing a single line of code
- **Accelerate development** with coordinated multi-agent workflows
- **Optimize for product/market fit** through continuous feedback loops

## 📦 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To clone FitFinder with all submodules included:

```bash
# Clone with all submodules in one command
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/natea/fitfinder.git
cd fitfinder
```

### Already Cloned? Initialize Submodules

If you've already cloned the repository without submodules:

```bash
# Initialize and update all submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Update Submodules

To pull the latest changes from all submodules:

```bash
# Update all submodules to their latest commits
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

- And many more...

## 🚦 Quick Start Workflow

### 1. Setup MCP Servers (Required)

```bash
# Add Claude Flow (required for agent coordination)
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start

# Optional: Enhanced coordination
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start

# Optional: Cloud features
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start
```

### 2. Initialize Your First Product Discovery

```bash
# Use SPARC methodology for systematic discovery
npx claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Discover product opportunities in [your market]"

# Spawn research agents for market analysis
npx claude-flow swarm init --topology mesh --max-agents 5

# Run parallel market research
npx claude-flow sparc batch researcher,analyst "Analyze [your target market]"
```

### 3. Validate Your Product Idea

```bash
# Run TDD workflow for rapid validation
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "Build MVP for [your product idea]"

# Execute full pipeline
npx claude-flow sparc pipeline "Product validation for [target audience]"
```

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Product/Market Fit Framework

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Use researcher and analyst agents to explore markets
   - Identify pain points and opportunities
   - Map competitive landscapes

2. **Definition Phase**
   - Define target audience with precision
   - Create detailed user personas
   - Validate assumptions with data

3. **Development Phase**
   - Build MVPs using SPARC methodology
   - Iterate based on feedback loops
   - Scale with multi-agent coordination

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Continuous validation and optimization
   - Automated testing and quality assurance
   - Performance monitoring and improvement

### AI Agent Coordination

FitFinder uses **concurrent execution patterns** where all operations happen in parallel:
- **1 Message = All Related Operations**
- Batch todos, file operations, and agent spawning
- 2.8-4.4x speed improvement over sequential execution
- 32.3% token reduction through optimization
